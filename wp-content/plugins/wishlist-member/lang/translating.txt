Translating WishList Member

I. Create the correct language file

1. Download poEdit at www.poedit.net
2. Open the file lang/wishlist-member-en_US.po
3. Click File -> Save As and change en_US to anything you want
   (i.e. de for German) so that the filename becomes something
   like wishlist-member-de.po
4. Translate
5. Click File -> Save.  This should generate a new .po and a
   new .mo file.  If poEdit does not generate the .mo file
   automatically, just go to File -> Preferences -> Editor and
   check the box that says "Automatically compile .mo file on save"
6. Upload new .po and .mo file

This now generates the correct .po and .mo files for your language.

II. Tell Wordpress to use your language file

1. Edit wp-config.php
2. Locate the line that says: define ('WPLANG', '');
3. Change it to: define ('WPLANG, 'de');
   (Note, use whatever language code you used when you
    made your translation in step I-3)
4. Save wp-config.php
